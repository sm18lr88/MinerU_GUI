# MinerU_GUI
GUI for [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU)

At the moment you can just select the PDF → it will auto-select the same output folder (unless you change it) → just click `Process PDF` for it to process the entire thing and include the markdown format. No need to fill out page range or language.

Tkinter-based, so no requirements other than python and MinerU. You do need to install MinerU beforehand though.

Just starting the project. So far app has worked well enough. Maybe someone will find it useful.

I do plan to keep working on this project.
